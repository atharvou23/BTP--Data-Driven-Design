# BTP- Data Driven Design of load bearing members
Our motivation is to propose Data-Driven design as a way to eliminate
epistemic uncertainties linked to traditional constitutive models in mechanical
design. By eschewing empirical models, data driven design can eliminate
modelling error and uncertainty, and no loss of experimental information is
incurred.
